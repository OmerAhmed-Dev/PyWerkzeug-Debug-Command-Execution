# PyWerkzeug-Debug-Command-Execution
python3 exploit for werkzeug debug shell command execution

## IDEA
People would say it's based on MSF exploit (https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/http/werkzeug_debug_rce.rb), but as I couldn't understand at all this exploit, I did it my own exploit.

## Thanks to
A. Perez for his help, and D. Fernandez for the idea.
